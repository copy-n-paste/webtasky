# 🧠 MyTask Web (a.k.a. I Don't Like Web Design)

> A simple task manager built using Firebase + Vanilla JavaScript  
> **Warning:** Built by someone who doesn't enjoy web design... but did it anyway. 😎

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔐 Google login via Firebase (because I'm not writing auth from scratch)
- 🔔 Real-time task notifications (only if you keep the **account page open** – yeah, weird, I know)
- 📅 Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed
- 💾 Everything saved in Firestore
- 🎨 Minimal UI. Looks decent. I'm surprised too.

## 🚀 Hosted Version

Yes, I actually hosted it. And no, I didn’t enjoy the CSS part.

👉 [Try the Live Demo](https://mytaskwebapp.web.app)

> Open the **account page** if you want to get those sleek notifications. If not, don’t complain when you forget your dentist appointment.

## 🧪 Why I built this?

> Just for fun.  
> Now you go have fun too…  
> …**with all my bugs and typos.** 🤡  
>  
> I won’t fix them unless they explode. Maybe not even then.

## 🐍 Parallel Python Version?

Yes! Because I love Python (and it doesn’t involve CSS).

👉 [Check out the Python version here](https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-py)  
> It’s CLI-based and way more peaceful to work with.

## 🙏 Final Words

If it breaks, just refresh.  
If it still breaks, pretend it’s a feature.  
If it works, wow.
