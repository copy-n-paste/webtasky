or deploy this code into space — as long as you agree to the following:

1. You do NOT blame me if it breaks.  
2. You do NOT ping me at 3 AM asking why your task disappeared.  
3. You do NOT use it to build Skynet. Seriously.  
4. You MAY flex it in front of your friends, but give credit.  

The software is provided "as is", with no warranty — not even the kind 
you get from shady street vendors selling USB fans. Use it at your own 
risk, joy, and weirdness.

TL;DR: Do whatever, just don’t sue me, okay?
